# threejs web exercise
This repository follows the Three.js tutorial from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YK1Sw_hnm58&ab_channel=ChrisCourses
## Differences with tutorial
- I used the Live Server extension from VisualStudio Code to run the project
- Whereas in the tutorial the libraries are installed with npm and node.js, I used the cdn for every library 
- I created a separate css file instead of writing directly in the styles tag
